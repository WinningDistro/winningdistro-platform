# WinningDistro Platform - Captcha Removal & Streamlining

## ✅ TASK COMPLETED: Removed Captcha Verification

**User Request**: "Remove captcha from signup page and try again with as little token as possible"

### Changes Made:

1. **Schema Updates** ✅
   - ✅ Removed `recaptcha` field from base signup schema in `signup-schemas.ts`
   - ✅ Removed captcha validation from main `Signup.tsx` schema
   - ✅ Updated form options to remove captcha field initialization

2. **Frontend Cleanup** ✅
   - ✅ Removed `HCaptchaComponent` imports from all signup forms
   - ✅ Removed captcha handlers (`onCaptchaVerify`, `onCaptchaError`, `onCaptchaExpired`)
   - ✅ Removed captcha field initialization from form defaults
   - ✅ Removed entire "Security Verification" sections from JSX
   - ✅ Cleaned up `ArtistSignupForm.tsx`, `LabelSignupForm.tsx`, and main `Signup.tsx`

3. **Server-Side Updates** ✅
   - ✅ Removed `recaptchaToken` from request body destructuring
   - ✅ Removed entire hCaptcha verification logic from auth route
   - ✅ Simplified registration flow - no more captcha validation

4. **API Calls** ✅
   - ✅ Removed `recaptchaToken` from all signup API requests
   - ✅ Removed captcha-related error handling

## Result: Streamlined Signup Process
